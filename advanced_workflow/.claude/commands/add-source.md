description: Guide for adding a new content source
---

You want to add a new content source (YouTube channel or blog). I'll guide you through:
1. The database structure for sources
2. How to add the source configuration
3. Writing or adapting the scraper
4. Testing the new source

Ask me what type of source you want to add and provide the URL.
