      "review_text": "I love being able to track all the live stats during the game. The shot charts, player comparisons, and possession breakdowns are fantastic. The interface is clean and easy to navigate. However, I've noticed the stats sometimes lag behind the actual game by a few plays. It's usually only a few seconds, but it can be frustrating when you're trying to follow along in real-time. Still a great feature overall.",

Unfortunately, the app crashed three times during the checkout process. I had to restart my phone and re-enter my payment information each time. When I finally got through, the seats I originally selected were no longer available. Customer support has not responded to my emails. I'll stick to buying tickets through the website next time.",

The ability to see menus and order food directly from the app was incredibly convenient. The map was easy to navigate and the directions were accurate. This made my game day experience much more enjoyable. I wish more sports apps had this feature!",
